# Introduction
A blog is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.

# Purpose of the project:
It was one of my dreams to build my blog, and that because I want to publish my ideas in designing, studying, cooking, photography, programming, and so many else, and I want to publish it in a simple, well organized, and useful way,
So that I will benefit my society by my knowledge and what I am good at, and I will be closer to them.

What distinguishes my website most, is the beautiful and simple design that gives the user a feeling of comfort, and helps the user to know all the sections of the blog easily and clearly.
